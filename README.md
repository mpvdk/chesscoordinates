# Chess Coordinates- and Memory- Practice App

This is a simple web-app that helps you get better at chess. 
It has 5 practice modes:

1. ranks - practice identifying just ranks
2. files - practice identifying just files
3. squares - practice identifying squares
4. colours - practice associating colours with algebraic notations
5. position - practice to recreate positions from memory

It is deployed at https://www.chesscoordinates.com

# Stack

Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app is not complicated enough to merit a framework.

# Contributing

Find an issue with the app or have any suggestions? Your input is welcom. Open an issue or create a pull request.

# To-do:

- Apply minimisation - I have parcel configured but it's causing some issues on Cloudflare pages. The site is very small as is so it's not a big deal really.
- Add more fen-notation positions and think of a better way to serve them on demand (current setup adds bytes for every position added of course).
