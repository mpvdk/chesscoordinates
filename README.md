This is a simple web-app that helps you improve your memory for chess and master algebraic notation.

It has 6 practice modes:

1. ranks - identify ranks
2. files - identify files
3. squares - identify squares
4. colours - associate colours with algebraic notations
5. moves - make moves based on algebraic notation
5. position - recreate positions from memory


It is deployed at https://www.chesscoordinates.com

# Stack

Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app is not complicated enough to merit a framework.

# To-do:

- ~~Apply minimisation - I have parcel configured but it's causing some issues on Cloudflare pages. The site is very small as is so it's not a big deal really~~
- Add more fen-notation positions and think of a better way to serve them on demand (current setup adds bytes for every position added of course)
- Same for pgn games
- Improve SEO
- Sell to big chess company
- Retire
